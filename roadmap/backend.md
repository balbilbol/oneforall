   5. API Security Best Practices
      1. Authentication
         - Avoid ‘Basic Authentication’, use standard (e.g. JWT)
         - Do not reinvent the wheel in authentication mechanisms
         - Use `Max Retry’ and jail features in Login
         - Use encryption on all sensitive data
      2. JWT
         - Use good 'JWT Secret' to make brute force attacks difficult
         - Do not extract the algorithm from the header, use backend
         - Make token expiration (TTL, RTTL) as short as possible
         - Avoid storing sensitive data in JWT payload
         - Keep the payload small to reduce the size of the JWT
      3. Access Control
         - Limit requests (throttling) to avoid DDoS/Brute Force
         - Use HTTPS on server side and secure ciphers
         - Use HSTS header with SSL to avoid SSL Strip attacks
         - Turn off directory listings
         - Private APIs to be only accessible from safe listed IPs
      4. OAuth
         - Always validate `redirect_uri’ on server-side
         - Avoid `response_type=token’ and try to exchange for code
         - Use `state’ parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
         - Have default scope, and validate scope for each application
      5. Input
         - Use proper HTTP methods for the operation
         - Validate `content-type` on request header
         - Validate user input to avoid common vulnerabilities
         - Use standard Authorization header for sensitive data
         - Use only server-side encryption
         - Use an API Gateway for caching, Rate Limit policies etc
      6. Processing
         - Check if all the endpoints are protected behind authentication to avoid broken authentication process
         - Avoid user’s personal ID in the resource URLs e.g. users/242/orders
         - Prefer using UUID over auto-increment IDs
         - Disable entity parsing if you are parsing XML to avoid XXE attacks
         - Disable entity expansion if using XML, YML or any other language
         - Use CDN for file uploads
         - Avoid HTTP blocking if you are using huge amount of data
         - Make sure to turn the debug mode off in production
         - Use non-executable stacks when available
      7. Output
         - Send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
         - Send `X-Frame-Options: deny` header
         - Send `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` header
         - Remove fingerprinting headers (i.e. x-powered-by etc)
         - Force `content-type` for your response
         - Avoid returning sensitive data (credentials, sec. tokens etc)
         - Return proper response codes as per the operation
      8. CI/CD
         - Audit your design and implementation with unit/integration tests
         - Use a code review process and disregard self-approval
         - Continuously run security analysis on your code
         - Check your dependencies for known vulnerabilities
         - Design a rollback solution for deployments
      9. Monitoring
         - Use centralized logins for all services and components
         - Use agents to monitor all requests, responses and errors
         - Use alerts for SMS, Slack, Email, Kibana, Cloudwatch, etc
